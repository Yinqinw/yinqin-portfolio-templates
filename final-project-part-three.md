# Changes made since Part II
Since Part II, I developed the North American market section in my project to create a more complete and cohesive story. In parts 1 and 2, I originally planned to use "The Last Duel" as an example to show how star power impacts film box office in the American film industry. But after I finished the Chinese market section, I realized that if I give another example of the impact and change of star power on a single film would feel repetitive and boring for the audience. So in order to keep the content engaging, I decided to take a different approach for North America, focusing on actors and their relationship with franchise storytelling. This also allowed me to highlight subtle differences in how star power is influenced by different factors in China and North America, beyond the same declining trend.

Additionally, because some of the films used as examples are still in theaters, I updated their box office data to reflect the most recent numbers.

Regarding copyright concerns, I saw the feedback from Part II and checked my use of movie posters. I decided to remove all American movie posters while keeping the Chinese ones. Because I have worked in the Chinese film industry and have been deeply involved in film marketing work there. Based on my first-hand experience, I know that movie posters in China are generally considered public materials that can be freely used for non-commercial purposes and even in for-profit documents. When I worked in film marketing, we were allowed to use official posters and celebrity images in pitch decks and briefs. However, I am not sure if the same applies to the American industry, so I chose to remove some posters and keep some for visual considerations. I also added citations and links on my shorthand page for all the posters I used.

Lastly, I modified the call-to-action section to make it clearer and more actionable. Previously, my recommendations were too broad, so I revised them to provide more specific and practical suggestions.

## The audience
My target audience remained the same as I initially planned in Part I:
- Film industry professionals
- Fan communities

Overall my target audience hasn't changed much. For film industry practitioners, I just further divided this group into two parts, producers and marketers, because I want to provide more detailed suggestions for each area. Other than this I followed my design in part 1 just well.

## References
I use APA 7th style for all my citations in Shorthand.
