# Wireframes / storyboards

I create my wireframe directly in Shorthand.

Link: [Does Star Power Equal Box Office Success?](https://preview.shorthand.com/n3TJPiUt112zR4Jx)

# User research 

## Target audience
I hope to reach this story to:

- Film industry professionals: Producers, marketers, and talent managers who want to better understand audience behavior and how to allocate resources. 
- Fan communities: To help fans recognize that a movie’s success doesn’t rely solely on “your favorite star.” Sometimes, excessive fan-driven viral marketing can backfire and reduce mainstream interest.

## Interviewees 
How do I identify representative individuals: In class assigned teammates will be my interviewees. 

My three teammates are from the MAM, PPM and MISM programs.

## Interview script
> The goals of my research are to hear feedback from someone who isn't familiar with this field and to see whether they can understand it and think my content is clear and engaging enough for the audience.

### Question to Ask
1. Was the main message clear to you? Did you understand what this project is trying to show?
2. Which part of the visuals or explanations was the most engaging? What did you like the most?
3. Was anything confusing or missing? Are there areas where you wanted more explanation or a different presentation of data?
4. How can I improve this project? What suggestions do you have for making the story or visuals clearer and more engaging?

# Identified changes for Part III

- I am considering changing “The Last Duel” example to another film that can better build my case, but if I can't find a film I want, I will come back to this one in the end.
- I am planning to add a key term section to briefly explain key industry terms since my target audience is not all inside the industry.
- Lastly, **I need to improve all my charts greatly**. Find more data and create metrics that can measure the vague star power into numbers.
