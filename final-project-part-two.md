# Wireframes / storyboards

I create my wireframe directly in Shorthand.

Link: [Does Star Power Equal Box Office Success?](https://preview.shorthand.com/n3TJPiUt112zR4Jx)

# User research 

## Target audience
I hope to reach this story to:

- Film industry professionals: Producers, marketers, and talent managers who want to better understand audience behavior and how to allocate resources. 
- Fan communities: To help fans recognize that a movie’s success doesn’t rely solely on “your favorite star.” Sometimes, excessive fan-driven viral marketing can backfire and reduce mainstream interest.

## Interviewees 
How do I identify representative individuals: In class assigned teammates will be my interviewees. 

My three teammates are from MAM, PPM and MISM program.

## Interview script
> The goals from me research is to hear feedbacks from someone isn't familiar with this field and to see whether they can understand it and think my content is clear and engaging enough for the aoudience.

1. Was the main message clear to you? Did you understand what this project is trying to show?
2. Which part of the visuals or explanations was the most engaging? What did you like the most?
3. Was anything confusing or missing? Are there areas where you wanted more explanation or a different presentation of data?
4. How can I improve this project? What suggestions do you have for making the story or visuals clearer and more engaging?
