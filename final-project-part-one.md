# Outline
### Summary
In this project, I will explore how star power influences box office performance in North America and China, focusing on recent examples from both markets. While it is commonly believed that popular actors and social media buzz guarantee box office success, the data reveals a more complex story. Through this project, I want to show that the relationship between celebrity popularity and box office performance is not always predictable.

For the Chinese market, I will use the most recent 2025 Chinese New Year film season. Despite the presence of high-profile stars in several films, it was an animated franchise film that dominated the box office, while movies with the most popular celebrities and renowned directors underperformed. This will demonstrate how audience preferences and other factors can outweigh pure star power.

In the North American market, the narrative often follows a similar but slightly different pattern. While A-list actors can drive significant interest, recent box office hits also show that strong storytelling, critical acclaim, and even niche appeal can matter more than star-studded casts. 
### Target Audience
Film industry professionals: Producers, marketers, and talent managers who want to better understand audience behavior and how to allocate resources.
Fan communities: To help fans recognize that a movie’s success doesn’t rely solely on “your favorite star.” Sometimes, excessive fan-driven viral marketing can backfire and reduce mainstream interest.
- In the Chinese market, the movie "The Legend of the Condor Heroes: The Great Hero" (2025)《射雕英雄传：侠之大者》 is an example of how high anticipation driven by passionate fan support doesn’t always translate to box office success. Despite featuring a popular actor with a strong online following, the movie underperformed compared to expectations, and the constant fan-driven promotion on platforms like Weibo and Xiaohongshu eventually led to audience resentment and backlash.
- In the North American market, "The Last Duel" (2021), despite having A-list stars, critical acclaim, and being called an underrated masterpiece by fans, did not do well at the box office due to niche appeal and fan overhype.
### Call to Action
While star power and social media presence are essential for generating interest, they are not guaranteed predictors of box office success. Both markets reveal that factors such as storytelling quality, timing, and genre can play a significant role.

For industry professionals, it’s crucial not to place excessive reliance on fan-driven hype. Unlike streaming platforms, TV dramas, or idol-related products, theatrical films target a much wider audience beyond typical fan groups.
- Focus on delivering high-quality stories that resonate with different demographics.
- Balance marketing strategies to combine the appeal of star power with the essence that makes a film stand out.
- Understand that viral fan-driven promotions may even backfire by alienating casual moviegoers.

I also plan to create Star Power Heatmap of top actors’ and directors’ influence on box office.

# The data

I divided the data I need for this project into three catagory.
1. Box office data
- China: Maoyan Pro and Dengta（灯塔专业版）. Both are mainstream platforms for getting box office data in Chinese film industry.
- North America: Box Office Mojo and The Numbers
2. Fan base size data
- China: Weibo, Douyin, Xiaohongshu
- North America: Instagram, Twitter, TikTok
3. Social Media Buzz
- China:  Weibo trending list, Douyin topic views, Xiaohongshu post views.
- North America: Twitter mentions, hashtag trends, Instagram posts.

How the Data Will Be Used:
- **Box Office vs. Fan Base Size:** show whether there is a consistent pattern between a star’s social media following and their film’s box office success.
- **Box Office vs. Social Media Buzz:** Show whether the intensity of online discussions predicts a movie’s box office performance, or if excessive hype can sometimes have the opposite effect.

`Note: I acknowledge that movie ratings (eg. Douban, IMDb) are crucial indicators of a film’s reception, but I want this project to focus on star power and social media influence to maintain a clear and focused story, so I will not include Douban or IMDb ratings in my main data set.`
