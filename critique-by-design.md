# Assignment: Critique and redesign

## Step one: the visualization
Title of the article: "Ranked: Top 10 Countries by Military Spending"

link: [https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-top-10-countries-by-military-spending](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-top-10-countries-by-military-spending) (Conte, 2022)


I selected this graph because the overall green color immediately caught my eye and the top about military spending is relevantly new to me, so I think I can approach it with a fresh eye and gain some new knowledge about the military.

## Step two: the critique
Here is the summary of what I scored in the Google Form

- Usefulness: 6
- Completeness: 9
- Perceptibility: 4
- Truthfulness: 7
- Intuitiveness: 7
- Aesthetics: 4
- Engagement: 8

_Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently?_

**My answer:** I think this graph is overall clear about what it means. I can see each country’s military spending immediately. However, the color assigned to different countries is not clear. At first, I thought the lighter the green is, the lower the military spending is for those countries. But then I noticed that No.2, 3, 8, 10 and 9 are in the same color. It was very confusing until one of my teammates in class pointed out that the colors were assigned by regions like Asia, Europe and North America. But I still think there is no need to assign colors like that. Also, the shape of each area is irregular. This is not helpful for readers to see the percentage of each country's military spending directly. I think a regular pie chart will be enough to show that.

_Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not?_

**My answer:** United Nations, military analysts, government and military forces are the primary audience. I think overall this graph is effective for reaching those audiences because it shows the most important information in a prominent way despite some minor ambiguity.

_Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)_

**My answer:** I think this method asks more about general feelings instead of judgment. It can add some questions directly asking about details like "Is the color combination reasonable?" Or "Is the layout the reasonable type for delivering information?"

## Step three: Sketch a solution

![IMG_0237](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da8bdf24-10f3-4944-80e3-5c86991d5836)

## Step four: Test the solution

My three teammates in class are from Health Care, MEIM and PPM program.

Questions to ask: 
- Can you tell me what you think this is?

    Both three said it is a military expanse graph and it's clear to see that.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

    One said that it is interesting to see that Russia's military spending is going down given that they are in a state of war.

    Other two of my teammates said they were surprised to see how much the US spends on the military and they are the highest.

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

    UN, government entity. One said this graph is intended to inform the US that they spend too much on military.
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
   
    They pointed out that I should label the number and also put the country's name right next to the line so that the readers will not need to match them together with their eyes. Also in my original sketch, I only draw 5 countries but I write a title of 10 countries. So they think I should either add 5 more countries or change the title.

Results: They think my adjustment to make a line chart makes more sense than the original pie chart because it shows more information and visualizes the trends.

Synthesis: The feedback is about details in the graph like labels, titles and numbers. I learned that I need to be more detailed in my final draft.

## Step five: build the solution

I used Tableau to create my final graph. In the "SIPRI Military Expenditure Database", I am able to find the data for more countries. So instead of changing my title from 10 to 5 countries, I add 5 more countries' data. I created a line chart similar to my sketch, which shows the trend over a period of time and makes comparisons between different countries, but by using Tableau, readers can click on the line they are interested in and see the numbers themselves. It is more convenient for them to show specific numbers and labels they chose instead of seeing all the information at once which sometimes can be overwhelming. Also, I don't know how to add numbers next to a line in Tableau, so I am not able to make this change on my teammate's feedback.

Additionally, in the original article, they used a pie chart to show one year of military spending, but as I mentioned in the Google Form, I don't think the irregular shape is effective in terms of delivering the message. So I create a regular pie chart as well.
